    <h1>Quips</h1>
    <p>
      Here are some quips, don't take these too seriously.
      Things I write here are things I want to write down which is not guaranteed to have any value or lack of value.
      I expect most to be effectively indistinguishable from pure pretentiousness.
      Unless you admit pretentiousness, you cannot assume any of these true.
      But if you admit pretentiousness, you admit pretense, which is false.
      By the principle of explosion, admitting pretense results in a meaningless logic.
      Thus, you cannot assume any of these true.

      In engineering, it's not enough to simply make something and then make it correct.
      When that is done, the correctness becomes incidental and consequently fragile.
      One should strive not to make that which is correct but to realize correctness from the start.

      A society defines its own criminals and enemies.
      If a society defines its own as criminals and enemies, then a society makes its own into criminals and enemies.
      Then a society, being its own criminals and enemies, will end.
