    <p>
      My name is Dakota Fisher.
      I am currently looking for employment.
      I'm interested in programming languages, especially logic programming.
      All I want for Christmas this year is at least one of:
      <ul>
	      <li>proof by induction in a logic programming language</li>
              <li>efficient and complete proof search in a dependently-typed language</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      At some point I intend to start adding notes on things here.
